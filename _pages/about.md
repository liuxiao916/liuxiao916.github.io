I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at **Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen**, supervised by **Professor [Haoyao Chen](https://www.nrs-lab.com/people-2/)**, and pursuing a joint Ph.D. program with **City University of Hong Kong** under the supervision of **Professor [Lu Liu](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/mne/people/academic-staff/prof-liu-lu)**. 

Before that, I obtained my Master’s degree in Control Science and Engineering and Bachelor’s degree in Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology.

My research interests focus on **robot perception and intelligent navigation**.
